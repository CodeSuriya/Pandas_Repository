**Dataset Description and Cleaning Process**


In this project, I worked on cleaning a dataset using Python's pandas library. The dataset contains various columns, including mixed values and null entries that required preprocessing and transformation.

I applied the following pandas methods to clean and enhance the dataset:

> fillna(): Filled missing values with appropriate data.

> replace(): Replaced specific values in the dataset, improving consistency.

> value_counts(): Generated counts of unique values in columns, helping with data analysis.

> sum(): Summed up specific columns to identify key data points.

> lambda: Used lambda functions to apply custom operations on the dataset.

> isnull(): Detected missing values and handled them appropriately.

> Column pop(): Removed unnecessary columns for a cleaner dataset.

> rename(): Renamed columns for better readability and consistency.


**** I focused on cleaning and transforming data in a pandas DataFrame, specifically working with a column that contained mixed data types (numeric strings and text). I successfully completed the following tasks:

Converted Numeric Strings to Float:

Used pandas to identify and convert numeric string values (e.g., "21", "15.5") into their corresponding float representations. This process was crucial in standardizing the data for further manipulation.

Converted Float Values to Text Based on Conditions:

After converting the numeric strings, I categorized the float values into text based on specific conditions. For example:
>> Values between 1 and 30 were labeled as "Needs Significant Improvement".
>> Values between 31 and 60 were labeled as "Meets Expectations".
>> Values above 60 were labeled as "Exceeds Expectations".
>> Non-numeric values (like "Exceeds Expectation" or "Need Improvement") remained unchanged, preserving the integrity of the original data.)

This process deepened my understanding of data cleaning and transformation using pandas, and it was a valuable learning experience to explore how to handle mixed data types effectively in Python.
