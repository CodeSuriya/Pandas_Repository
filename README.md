**Dataset Description and Cleaning Process**


In this project, I worked on cleaning a dataset using Python's pandas library. The dataset contains various columns, including mixed values and null entries that required preprocessing and transformation.

I applied the following pandas methods to clean and enhance the dataset:

> fillna(): Filled missing values with appropriate data.

> replace(): Replaced specific values in the dataset, improving consistency.

> value_counts(): Generated counts of unique values in columns, helping with data analysis.

> sum(): Summed up specific columns to identify key data points.

> lambda: Used lambda functions to apply custom operations on the dataset.

> isnull(): Detected missing values and handled them appropriately.

> Column pop(): Removed unnecessary columns for a cleaner dataset.

> rename(): Renamed columns for better readability and consistency.
